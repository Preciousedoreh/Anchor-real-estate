/**
 * Society crest — the cooperative's seal, a gold anchor and portico on a forest
 * field. The artwork is masked to its circle with transparent corners, so it
 * sits directly on either ground with no plate behind it.
 *
 * `className` handles layout; `size` is the intrinsic width Next.js optimises
 * for, so set it to the largest CSS size the call site renders. `eager` loads
 * it with the page for instances above the fold (Next 16 retired `priority`).
 * The seal is decorative wherever the society name sits beside it, which is
 * every current call site — pass `alt` only if that stops being true.
